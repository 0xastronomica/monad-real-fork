# Architecture of the L2 Solution on Monad Blockchain

## Overview

The L2 solution on the Monad blockchain is designed to enhance scalability and efficiency by providing a layer of abstraction over the base layer. This architecture outlines the key components and their interactions within the system.

## Components

### 1. Sequencer

The Sequencer is responsible for managing the order of transactions. It ensures that transactions are processed in a consistent manner, preventing issues such as double spending. The main functionalities include:

- **Enqueue Transaction**: Adds a transaction to the processing queue.
- **Process Queue**: Processes transactions in the order they were received.

### 2. Prover

The Prover generates cryptographic proofs for transactions, ensuring their validity before they are committed to the blockchain. Key methods include:

- **Generate Proof**: Creates a proof for a given transaction.
- **Verify Proof**: Validates the proof to ensure the transaction's integrity.

### 3. Relayer

The Relayer acts as a bridge between the L2 solution and the Monad blockchain. It handles the communication and ensures that transactions are sent and received correctly. Its main functions are:

- **Send Transaction**: Sends a transaction to the Monad blockchain.
- **Receive Transaction**: Listens for and processes incoming transactions from the blockchain.

### 4. Client

The Client provides an interface for users to interact with the L2 solution. It abstracts the complexities of the underlying architecture and offers a user-friendly experience. Important methods include:

- **Submit Transaction**: Allows users to submit transactions to the L2 solution.
- **Get Transaction Status**: Retrieves the status of a submitted transaction.

## Communication

The components communicate with each other through well-defined interfaces, ensuring modularity and ease of maintenance. Protobuf definitions are used for serialization and deserialization of messages exchanged between components.

## Security Considerations

Security is a critical aspect of the architecture. Each component must implement best practices to safeguard against vulnerabilities, including proper validation of inputs and secure handling of cryptographic keys.

## Conclusion

This architecture provides a robust framework for developing an L2 solution on the Monad blockchain. By clearly defining the roles and responsibilities of each component, we can ensure a scalable, efficient, and secure system.
